  <h1>Mak kep</h1>
  <img src="img/poor.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="img/games 3">Mak Kep is a beloved traditional Thai children's game that emphasizes dexterity, timing, and hand-eye coordination. Played mostly by girls in rural villages, especially before the era of digital entertainment, the game involves a set of small objects—typically stones, seeds, or metal pieces—that players must pick up in increasingly challenging patterns while tossing one into the air and catching it. Simple in materials but rich in motor skill development, Mak Kep was a common pastime during school breaks or after chores. It nurtured patience, focus, and playful competitiveness among children, often played in groups with laughter and cheering. Though considered a quiet and humble game compared to sports, Mak Kep holds a cherished place in Thailand's cultural memory as a reflection of traditional childhood, where creativity and interaction outweighed technology and toys.</p>
