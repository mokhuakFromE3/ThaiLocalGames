<h1> Sepak Takraw</h1>
  <img src="img/sepak.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="games 1"> SepakTakraw is one of Thailand's most iconic traditional sports, showcasing a unique blend of agility, coordination, and acrobatics. Often referred to as “kick volleyball,” Takraw is played with a woven rattan ball, and players use their feet, head, chest, and knees to strike the ball over a net. Its origins trace back several centuries when it was initially a cooperative circle game rather than a competitive sport. Over time, it evolved into a fast-paced team game with rules similar to volleyball, yet completely reliant on footwork and flexibility. Takraw is deeply embedded in Thai culture, especially in schools and rural communities, where children and adults alike take pride in mastering its skills. The sport symbolizes Thai resilience, creativity, and competitiveness, and today, Thailand is recognized as one of the global leaders in Takraw, dominating international tournaments and elevating the game to a symbol of national identity.</p>
