  <h1>Krabi Krabong</h1>
  <img src="img/sigma.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="games 2">Krabi Krabong is a traditional Thai martial art that blends historical battlefield tactics with ceremonial elegance. It involves the use of weapons, primarily the krabi (a curved sword) and krabong (a staff), though other weapons such as spears and shields are also part of its practice. Rooted in Thailandâ€™s ancient military traditions, Krabi Krabong was once the main combat technique used by Siamese warriors to defend the kingdom. Today, while no longer used for war, it survives as a deeply respected martial art form, often demonstrated in festivals, royal ceremonies, and cultural exhibitions. The movements are swift, rhythmic, and often choreographed, reflecting both the martial discipline and aesthetic performance. Beyond self-defense, Krabi Krabong represents spiritual discipline, physical control, and a deep respect for Thai heritage, often passed down through generations in traditional martial schools.
